**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the topic of consensus mechanisms, where we look into and compare different consensus mechanisms such as proof of work and proof of stake, and determine their merits and demerits over each other. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One potential investigation I would like to pursue for Quarter 2 Project is applying smart contracts for real estate transactions. Currently real estate transactions are an arduous process, in which all negotiations and verification require a third party, in this case, the real estate agent, to mediate between both buying and selling parties. If smart contract and blockchain technology is applied to real estate transactions, then it eliminates the need for a middleman and also allows for privacy between both parties 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

For our Quarter 1 Project, we are currently building the backbone of a real estate marketplace applying smart contract and blockchain technology, and for our Quarter 2 Project, we are planning to build the front end of the website and application. As of right now, one potential change to our approach is to break down the project into smaller problems, because currently we are encountering many callback errors to our project and I believe we have to look more into different smaller sections of the code in order to resolve the issue. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Another technique I would be interested in using in my project is apply customer feedback to our platform. In this case, customers serve as beta testers for the platform to help find any bugs or errors while using our application.
